                Assessment, Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative, and Verbal.
                Familiarize yourself with the format and content of each section

              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Create a study plan: </span>Set aside dedicated time each
                week to study for the GMAT exam. Create a study plan that works
                for you and stick to it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Use official GMAT materials: </span>The GMAT exam is
                created by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), so
                it's important to use official GMAT materials when preparing for
                the exam. These materials are designed to closely mimic the
                actual exam, giving you a better idea of what to expect.

                <span>Practice, practice, practice: </span>Practice is essential
                when preparing for the GMAT exam. Take as many practice tests as
                possible to get a sense of the timing and types of questions
                you'll encounter on the exam. Analyze your results to identify
                areas where you need to improve.

                <span>Focus on your weaknesses: </span>Once you've identified
                your weaknesses, focus on improving them. For example, if you
                struggle with math, focus on studying math concepts and
                practicing math problems.
              </li>

                <span>Take breaks and stay motivated: </span>Studying for the
                GMAT exam can be mentally exhausting, so it's important to take
                breaks and stay motivated. Take breaks to rest your mind and
                recharge, and find ways to stay motivated, such as setting goals
                or studying with a friend.
              </li>
