          Welcome to our GRE exam preparation and registration page, your go-to
          resource for everything related to the GRE exam. The GRE (Graduate
          Record Examination) is an important test for those who want to pursue
          graduate-level studies in the United States, Canada, and other
          English-speaking countries. The exam is widely recognized and accepted
          by thousands of universities, colleges, and institutions in over 160
          countries around the world. By taking the GRE exam, you can
          demonstrate your readiness for graduate-level studies and increase
          your chances of being accepted into your desired program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GRE exam assesses your readiness for graduate-level academic work
          by measuring your verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and
          analytical writing skills. The computer-based exam takes about 3 hours
          and 45 minutes to complete and is divided into three main sections:
          Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, and Analytical Writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Verbal Reasoning section evaluates your ability to analyze and
          evaluate written material and synthesize information from it. The
          Quantitative Reasoning section assesses your problem-solving ability
          and your understanding of basic mathematical concepts. The Analytical
          Writing section measures your ability to articulate complex ideas and
          arguments clearly and effectively.

          Our comprehensive guide will provide you with everything you need to
          know to prepare for the GRE exam, from registration and test format to

          </button>
          <div className="collapse" id="greFormat">
            <p>
              The GRE exam consists of six sections, each designed to assess
              different aspects of your academic and English language
              proficiency. The exam is administered in a computer-based format,
              known as the GRE General Test, and takes approximately three hours
              and 45 minutes to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Verbal Reasoning section evaluates your ability to analyze and
              evaluate written material and synthesize information from it. This
              part of the GRE Exam has two sections containing 20 questions
              each. Each section must be completed in 30 minutes. So, you have a
              total of 40 questions to be completed in 60 minutes under Verbal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Quantitative Reasoning section assesses your problem-solving
              ability and your understanding of basic mathematical concepts.
              Just like the verbal part of the GRE Exam, the quantitative
              reasoning also has two sections containing 20 questions each. The
              difference is that each section of the GRE quantitative reasoning
              must be completed in 35 minutes each. So, you have a total of 40
              questions to be completed in 70 minutes under the quantitative
              reasoning.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Analytical Writing section measures your ability to articulate
              complex ideas and arguments clearly and effectively. This section
              has two tasks: an "Analyze an Issue" task and an "Analyze an
              Argument" task. Each task is timed at 30 minutes, and test takers
              have a total of 60 minutes to complete both tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the main sections, the GRE exam also includes an
              unscored experimental section which has absolutely no effect on
              your score and an unscored research section. The research section
              is used to develop new test questions, while the experimental
              section is used to test new questions that may appear on future
              exams. Sadly, these sections can appear at any time during the
              exam as either quantitative or verbal reasoning questions, and you
              won’t know which section is experimental. It is advised that you
              give your best to every section and question, instead of trying to
              figure out which section is experimental because you cannot tell
              the difference.
