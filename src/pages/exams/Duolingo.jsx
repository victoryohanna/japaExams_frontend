              Preparing for the Duolingo English Test (DET) requires a
              combination of language learning and test-taking strategies. Here
              are some tips to help you prepare for the exam:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Familiarize yourself with the exam format: </span>
                Take some time to familiarize yourself with the format of the
                exam and the types of questions you can expect to see. This will
                help you feel more comfortable and confident on test day.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Focus on all four language skills: </span>
                The DET assesses your reading, writing, speaking, and listening
                skills, so it's important to practice all four skills in your
                preparation. Use a variety of resources, such as textbooks,
                language apps, and online resources to improve your language
                skills.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span> Practice under timed conditions: </span>
                The DET is a timed exam, so it's important to practice under
                timed conditions to get used to the pace of the exam. Set a
                timer for each section and try to complete the questions within
                the given time frame.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Build your vocabulary: </span>A strong vocabulary is
                essential for success on the DET. Practice using new words in
                context and create flashcards to help you memorize new
                vocabulary.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Work on your grammar: </span>
                The DET assesses your knowledge of English grammar, so it's
                important to brush up on your grammar skills. Review grammar
                rules and practice using them in sentences and paragraphs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Practice speaking and listening skills: </span>
                The speaking and listening sections of the DET require you to
                communicate in English, so it's important to practice speaking
                and listening skills regularly. Find a language partner or
                practice speaking with a tutor to improve your speaking skills,
                and listen to English-language podcasts and news reports to
                improve your listening skills.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span> Take practice exams: </span>
                Taking practice exams is an excellent way to prepare for the
                DET. There are several free practice exams available online, so
                take advantage of them to familiarize yourself with the exam
                format and to identify areas where you need to improve. You can
                practice with the Duolingo English Practice test and get an
                estimated score. This practice test is free, and you can take it
                as many times as you want.

          <div className="collapse" id="practice">
            <p>
              To prepare for the real test, Duolingo offers a free practice test
              that simulates the real exam format and provides an opportunity
              for test-takers like you to familiarize themselves with the exam
              structure, question types, and time limits. The free practice test
              lasts for about 8 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Duolingo practice test includes a range of questions similar
              to those found in the real test, and it offers a very good
              representation of the actual test-taking experience. The practice
              test provides feedback on your performance and offers an estimated
              score, which can help you assess your readiness for the real test.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the Duolingo practice test is a useful tool for preparing
              for the real exam, it is important to note that the real test may
              include different questions and tasks. The real test is a secure
              exam and test-takers are not allowed to share the content of the
              exam with others. Therefore, it is recommended to use the practice
              test as a supplement to your preparation and not rely on it as the
              sole preparation tool.
