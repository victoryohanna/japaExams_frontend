          <div className="collapse" id="greFormat">
            <p>
              The OET exam is divided into four sections, each designed to
              assess your abilities in different areas of the English language.
              The four sections are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Listening: </span>
                The listening component of the OET exam assesses your ability to
                understand spoken English in a healthcare setting. Candidates
                listen to recorded healthcare-related scenarios and answer
                multiple-choice questions based on what they hear.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Reading: </span>
                The reading component of the OET exam assesses your ability to
                read and understand healthcare-related texts. Candidates read a
                range of texts, including patient information leaflets,
                healthcare policies, and medical articles. They answer
                multiple-choice questions based on what they have read.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span> Writing: </span>
                The writing component of the OET exam assesses your ability to
                write accurately and effectively in a healthcare context.
                Candidates are given a case note based on a patient consultation
                and asked to write a letter to a healthcare professional. The
                letter may be a referral, a discharge summary, or a request for
                further investigations or treatment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Speaking: </span>
                The speaking component of the OET exam assesses your ability to
                communicate effectively in a healthcare setting. Candidates
                participate in role-plays that simulate typical interactions
                with patients, family members, or other healthcare
                professionals. They may be asked to take a patient history,
                explain a treatment plan, or provide health education.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The OET exam is graded on a scale of A to E, with A being the
              highest score and E the lowest. Candidates must achieve a minimum
              grade of B in each component to pass the exam. The exam is
              designed to assess your ability to use English language in a
              healthcare context, and the content is specific to the healthcare
              profession. These scores are determined by a team of trained
              assessors who use a detailed set of criteria to evaluate the
              candidate's performance in each component.
