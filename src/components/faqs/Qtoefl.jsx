            <span>Answer:</span>
            <p>
              On the day of the TOEFL test, you should arrive at the testing
              centre on time and with the necessary documents and materials. You
              should go to the testing centre with a valid international
              passport. The details on your international passport must exactly
              match the name you provided to us at the point of registration and
              must be in English or have an English translation.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no need to take any other document, apart from your
              international passport, to the test centre as all the writing
              materials you need will be provided at the venue. It is also a
              great idea to bring a small snack and a bottle of water, as the
              test can take several hours to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the test, you will be seated at a computer and given
              headphones and a microphone to use for the Speaking and Listening
              sections of the test. You will be timed for the exam and should,
              therefore, work as quickly and accurately as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the testing centre, you will be required to go through a
              security check and may be asked to remove any hats or jackets. You
              will also be required to place any personal belongings, such as
              phones and bags, in a designated area. Not to worry, all your
              items will be safely returned upon completion of your test. We
              advise that you remain focused and avoid distractions during the
              test. Follow all instructions carefully and don’t cheat or copy
              from other test takers. Your score will be cancelled without
              refund if you violate the rules of conduct such as cheating.

            <span>Answer:</span>
            <p>
              The scoring of the TOEFL test is based on a scale that ranges from
              0 to 120 points. Each section of the test (Reading, Listening,
              Speaking, and Writing) is scored separately, and the scores for
              each section are combined to give a total score.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Reading and Listening sections, you receive one point for
              each correct answer. There is no penalty for incorrect answers, so
              it is to your advantage to answer every question.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Speaking section is scored on a scale of 0 to 30 points.
              You'll receive a score of 0 to 4 points for each of the six tasks
              based on your ability to communicate effectively and use English
              grammar and vocabulary appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Writing section is also scored on a scale of 0 to 30 points.
              You will receive a score of 0 to 5 points for the independent task
              and a score of 0 to 5 points for the integrated task based on your
              ability to express your ideas clearly and effectively in writing.

            The following tips and strategies should go a long way in making you
            feel confident and prepared to take on the TOEFL exam:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Practice, practice, practice: The more you practice, the more
              comfortable you will be with the exam format and the more
              confident you will feel on test day. There are many online
              resources available, including practice tests and study guides,
              that can help you prepare for the exam.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improve your English skills: While it's important to practice for
              the TOEFL exam specifically, it's also important to improve your
              overall English language skills. Read English-language books and
              articles, watch English-language movies and TV shows, and practice
              speaking with native English speakers whenever possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take practice tests: Practice tests are a great way to get a sense
              of what the actual exam will be like. They can also help you
              identify areas where you need more practice and build your
              confidence.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set goals: Before you start studying, set specific goals for what
              you want to achieve. This can help you stay motivated and focused
              as you prepare for the exam.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find a study partner: Studying with a partner or group can be a
              great way to stay motivated and get feedback on your progress.
              Consider finding a language exchange partner or joining a study
              group in your area.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay organized: As you study, make sure to keep all of your notes,
              practice tests, and study materials organized. This can help you
              stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Manage your time wisely: On test day, it's important to pace
              yourself and manage your time wisely. You don't want to spend too
              much time on one question or section and run out of time before
              completing the entire exam.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay calm and focused: Test days can be stressful, but it's
              important to stay calm and focused. Take deep breaths, stay
              hydrated, and stay focused on the task at hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Get plenty of rest: Finally, it's important to get plenty of rest
              in the days leading up to the exam. A good night's sleep can help
              you feel refreshed and energized on test day.

              In general, a score of 100 or higher is considered a good score on
              the TOEFL test. However, the minimum score required for admission
              to a particular university or program may vary, so it is important
              for you to check the requirements of the institutions you are
              interested in attending. Some schools accept 70-80 as good scores
              too. The higher your score, the better.

              match your registration details exactly will be rejected. Avoid
