          Q: When should I take the GMAT exam?
        </Link>
        <div className="collapse" id="faqs_gmat4">
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> You can take the GMAT exam on any available
            date throughout the year, as the exam is offered on a continuous
            basis at testing centres in Nigeria and around the world. However,
            it is recommended that you register for the exam well in advance to
            ensure that you can secure your preferred date and testing location.
            Dates are competitive and fill up quickly as 100s of people register
            daily across Nigeria. Available dates will be displayed on this
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also important to note that some testing centres may have
            limited availability during peak testing periods, such as in the
            months leading up to MBA application deadlines. Therefore, it's best
            to plan ahead and schedule your exam as early as possible to avoid
            any potential scheduling conflicts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, you should take into consideration the application
            deadlines for the schools you are interested in attending, as you
            will need to have your GMAT scores submitted by those deadlines. You
            may want to give yourself enough time to retake the exam if
            necessary to achieve your desired score.

          Q: How can I prepare for the GMAT exam?
        </Link>
        <div className="collapse" id="faqs_gmat8">
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> Studying for the GMAT exam can be a demanding
            task, but with the right tips and strategies, you can increase your
            chances of success in the exam. You can prepare for the GMAT exam by
            using official GMAT prep materials, taking practice tests, and
            reviewing GMAT test-taking strategies. Some of our suggested
            strategies for preparing for your exam are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Understand the format and content of the exam: </span>The
              GMAT exam consists of four sections - Analytical Writing
              Assessment, Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative, and Verbal.
              Familiarize yourself with the format and content of each section
              so that you can develop an effective study plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Create a study plan: </span>Set aside dedicated time each
              week to study for the GMAT exam. Create a study plan that works
              for you and stick to it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Use official GMAT materials: </span>The GMAT exam is created
              by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), so it's
              important to use official GMAT materials when preparing for the
              exam. These materials are designed to closely mimic the actual
              exam, giving you a better idea of what to expect.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Practice, practice, practice: </span>Practice is essential
              when preparing for the GMAT exam. Take as many practice tests as
              possible to get a sense of the timing and types of questions
              you'll encounter on the exam. Analyze your results to identify
              areas where you need to improve.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Focus on your weaknesses: </span>Once you've identified your
              weaknesses, focus on improving them. For example, if you struggle
              with math, focus on studying math concepts and practicing math
              problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Take breaks and stay motivated: </span>Studying for the GMAT
              exam can be mentally exhausting, so it's important to take breaks
              and stay motivated. Take breaks to rest your mind and recharge,
              and find ways to stay motivated, such as setting goals or studying
              with a friend.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Get help if needed: </span>If you're struggling with a
              particular aspect of the exam, don't be afraid to seek help.
              Consider taking a prep course, hiring a tutor, or working with a
              study group to get the support you need.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>In all, preparing for the GMAT exam requires dedication, discipline, and a strategic approach. By following these tips and strategies, you can improve your chances of success on the GMAT exam and achieve your academic and professional goals.</p>

        <div className="collapse" id="faqs_gmat15">
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> It's important to arrive at the exam centre at least 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment time to allow time for check-in and security procedures. You only need to bring your valid international passport as this is the only means of identification recognised in Nigeria. In case you’re like me, you may need a light sweater or jacket for the cold in the testing room. The cold na mortuary standard. Lol. 

          </p>
          <p>
          You are also allowed to bring any other items that you may need during the exam, such as prescription eyeglasses, medications, or a medical device. You may not bring any other personal items like cell phones, wallets, purses, watches, and any other electronic devices with you to the exam centre, as they will not be allowed in the testing room. In case you bring them, the testing centre will usually provide a secure locker for you to store these personal items during the exam (Don’t worry, the key will be handed to you as you go in) and access them for snacks and water at break time.
