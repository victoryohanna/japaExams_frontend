          Q: What do I need to take the TOEFL centre?

            <span>Answer:</span>
            <p>
              On the day of the TOEFL test, you should arrive at the testing
              centre on time and with the necessary documents and materials. You
              should go to the testing centre with a valid international
              passport. The details on your international passport must exactly
              match the name you provided to us at the point of registration and
              must be in English or have an English translation.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no need to take any other document, apart from your
              international passport, to the test centre as all the writing
              materials you need will be provided at the venue. It is also a
              great idea to bring a small snack and a bottle of water, as the
              test can take several hours to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the test, you will be seated at a computer and given
              headphones and a microphone to use for the Speaking and Listening
              sections of the test. You will be timed for the exam and should,
              therefore, work as quickly and accurately as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the testing centre, you will be required to go through a
              security check and may be asked to remove any hats or jackets. You
              will also be required to place any personal belongings, such as
              phones and bags, in a designated area. Not to worry, all your
              items will be safely returned upon completion of your test. We
              advise that you remain focused and avoid distractions during the
              test. Follow all instructions carefully and donâ€™t cheat or copy
              from other test takers. Your score will be cancelled without
              refund if you violate the rules of conduct such as cheating.

          Q: How are TOEFL scores calculated?

            <span>Answer:</span>
            <p>
              The scoring of the TOEFL test is based on a scale that ranges from
              0 to 120 points. Each section of the test (Reading, Listening,
              Speaking, and Writing) is scored separately, and the scores for
              each section are combined to give a total score.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Reading and Listening sections, you receive one point for
              each correct answer. There is no penalty for incorrect answers, so
              it is to your advantage to answer every question.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Speaking section is scored on a scale of 0 to 30 points.
              You'll receive a score of 0 to 4 points for each of the six tasks
              based on your ability to communicate effectively and use English
              grammar and vocabulary appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Writing section is also scored on a scale of 0 to 30 points.
              You will receive a score of 0 to 5 points for the independent task
              and a score of 0 to 5 points for the integrated task based on your
              ability to express your ideas clearly and effectively in writing.

            The following tips and strategies should go a long way in making you
            feel confident and prepared to take on the TOEFL exam:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Practice, practice, practice: The more you practice, the more
              comfortable you will be with the exam format and the more
              confident you will feel on test day. There are many online
              resources available, including practice tests and study guides,
              that can help you prepare for the exam.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improve your English skills: While it's important to practice for
              the TOEFL exam specifically, it's also important to improve your
              overall English language skills. Read English-language books and
              articles, watch English-language movies and TV shows, and practice
              speaking with native English speakers whenever possible.
